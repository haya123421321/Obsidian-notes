## Sudo -l
List the programs which sudo allows your user to run:

`sudo -l`

Visit GTFOBins ([https://gtfobins.github.io](https://gtfobins.github.io/)) and search for some of the program names. If the program is listed with "sudo" as a function, you can use it to elevate privileges, usually via an escape sequence.

Or if you can do sudo with a custom script try to exploit it
